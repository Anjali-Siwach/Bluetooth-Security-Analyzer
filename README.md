# Bluetooth-Security-Analyzer
Developed ”Bluetooth Security Analyzer” tool with key features including device discovery, vulnerability scanning, traffic analysis, and mitigation recommendations.
Bluetooth connections, despite their convenience, expose users to security risks like eavesdropping and unauthorized pairing. Hackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to steal sensitive information. Our Bluetooth Security Analyzer project tackles this by offering a user-friendly tool. This tool empowers users by scanning for weaknesses in Bluetooth protocols and device configurations. It then provides mitigation strategies and solutions to fix these vulnerabilities, ultimately making Bluetooth connections safer for everyone and protecting your personal data.
